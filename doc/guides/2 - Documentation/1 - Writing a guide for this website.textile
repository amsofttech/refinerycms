h3. Create and format the guide

The best way for you to learn how to create a guide is to look at how a guide is structured. We are currently using the docrails project and as such all of the guides are written in textile.  Later we may move to a git backed solution so that you can contribute that way but for now we are entering the guides manually.

A good example of how a guide can be structured is the 'Getting Started With Refinery' guide which we have made available in "gist format here.":https://gist.github.com/raw/815791/getting_started_with_refinery.textile

You should be able to match the sections of the raw textile guide with the "live guide":/guides/getting-started-with-refinery to see how each aspect works.

h3. Submitting the guide

Now that you have a guide in textile format, please "let us know":/contact that you have done this so that we can put it live on the website. Make sure you provide us with a link to your gist so that we have the content in a safe way as copy pasting from email is often unreliable.  We will let you know when we put it live and/or if we have encountered any issues with it.
